```lrc
[00:12.01] Maybe I'm learning to love you less
[00:18.56] You've said your goodbyes but I haven't said mine yet
[00:26.37] I laid down in the fires and watched it turn blue
[00:33.52] As the cinders fill with memories of you
[00:39.23] But I'm okay now
[00:42.11] I've finally figured you out
[00:46.10] My rosy eyes are tired so I'll close 'em for now
[00:53.58] And I'm on my way out to paradise
[01:00.46] There's a world away that's waiting for me
[01:05.85] Waves always break when you're on my mind
[01:12.65] Now the absence of you sets me free
[01:18.33] You'd leave me notes 'round the house then you're gone
[01:23.40] Said things like, "I'm out, I'll be late, don't wait up"
[01:30.33] I let you keep your distance but I hated keeping mine
[01:36.73] If you loved thee, you would learn to compromise
[01:42.25] But I'm okay now (but I'm okay)
[01:45.21] I've finally figured you out (finally figured out)
[01:48.88] My rosy eyes are tired so I'll close 'em for now
[01:54.67] Close them for now
[01:56.39] And be on my way out to paradise (I'm on my way out to paradise)
[02:03.62] There's a world away that's waiting for me (I know you've been waiting)
[02:07.51] Waves always break when you're on my mind (they always break, you're on my mind, yeah)
[02:15.63] Now the absence of you sets me free
[02:20.59] And I'm on my way out to paradise
[02:27.11] To a world away that's waiting for me
[02:32.23] Waves always break when you're on my mind
[02:39.18] Now the absence of you sets me free
[02:45.71] Now, the absence of you sets me free
[02:50.15] Oh, the absence of you sets me free
[02:57.48] Oh, oh
[03:03.71] Oh, oh, oh
